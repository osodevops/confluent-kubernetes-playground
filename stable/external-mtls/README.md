## External mTLS
In this example we will generate our own certificates, and use them in place on our endpoints

* Generate a CA for certificate signing, which will be used for AutoGenerated certificate between the confluent components
* Use the same CA to generate a client certificate
* Write an ACL rule to allow client to write to topic
* Use client certificate to write to a topic using the stand alone rest proxy (new to CFK 2.2)
